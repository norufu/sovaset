THE PLAN

main goal : 
  show setups for sova on all maps
  wall bangs maybe
  plants big maybe


before release  
  -fix map svg issue CHECK?
  -fix UI on screens   CHECK
  -on hover for <g> elements CHECK 
  -images for main page buttons CHECK
  -CONTENT  CHECK
  -logo and name lol
  -about  CHECK
  -figure out a background/sidebar colour CHECK?

  bugs
  Clicking character icon or sonar icon doesn't load the screen CHECK
  opening a shock screen then closing results in sidebar being on sonar not shock. May have to pass in the current filter on load to the screen

can use figma to make svgs of the arrow paths/maps

project structure
  main page
    sova
      haven
        attack
          sonar
            format from - to
            t spawn - A site
          shock
        defense
          sonar
            heaven - long
          shock
      split
      etc
    viper
    etc


individual setups need
  data-id
  data-location
  data-type
  data-bounces
  data-charge
  data-side
maybe
  data-difficulty
  data-tooltip
  data-hovered (if I can't fix the css hovered)


component plan
  for the lineups could pull from a file? 
  have, new component(A site, B site, Elbow, etc) that creates a section for each specified, then it searches a file for those titles and auto fills in the images



b-b-b-b-bonus ideas
  interactable minimap for atk/def positions, hovering a position marked by a dot could show an arc to where it lands, allows quickly searching and clicking to see the setup
  callout maps
  wallbang spots


  



  goal: turn haven > map.vue component 
    - takes the map name as prop, 
    - renders slot
