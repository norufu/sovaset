THE PLAN

main goal : 
  show setups for sova on all maps
  wall bangs maybe
  plants big maybe


questions for enjoi
-ideal way to take what I have and put it to the other maps tool, I could just copy and paste but would you use a component? have a mouseclick listener on the main thing?
-should I be loading all this from a server, or some other way but not just having them in the public folder

can use figma to make svgs of the arrow paths/maps

project structure
  main page
    sova
      haven
        attack
          sonar
            format from - to
            t spawn - A site
          shock
        defense
          sonar
            heaven - long
          shock
      split
      etc
    viper
    etc


individual setups need
  data-id
  data-location
  data-type
  data-bounces
  data-charge
  data-side
maybe
  data-difficulty
  data-tooltip
  data-hovered (if I can't fix the css hovered)


component plan
  for the lineups could pull from a file? 
  have, new component(A site, B site, Elbow, etc) that creates a section for each specified, then it searches a file for those titles and auto fills in the images



b-b-b-b-bonus ideas
  interactable minimap for atk/def positions, hovering a position marked by a dot could show an arc to where it lands, allows quickly searching and clicking to see the setup
  callout maps
  wallbang spots
